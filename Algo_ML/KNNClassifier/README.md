## KNNClassifier Class Methods

### 1. Initialization (`__init__`)

```python
def __init__(self, k=3):
    self.k = k
```

- In the `__init__` method, the `KNNClassifier` object is initialized with an optional parameter `k`, which represents the number of neighbors to consider during classification. By default, `k` is set to 3 if not provided during object creation.

### 2. Fit Method (`fit`)

```python
def fit(self, X_train, y_train):
    self.X_train = X_train
    self.y_train = y_train
```

- The `fit` method is used to train the classifier. It takes two arguments: `X_train`, representing the training data (features), and `y_train`, representing the corresponding labels. Inside this method, the training data and labels are stored as attributes of the class instance (`self.X_train` and `self.y_train`, respectively).

### 3. Euclidean Distance Method (`euclidean_distance`)

```python
def euclidean_distance(self, x1, x2):
    return np.sqrt(np.sum((x1 - x2)**2))
```

- The `euclidean_distance` method calculates the Euclidean distance between two data points `x1` and `x2`. This distance metric is commonly used in KNN to measure the distance between a test sample and all training samples. It's computed as the square root of the sum of squared differences between corresponding elements of `x1` and `x2`.

### 4. Predict Method (`predict`)

```python
def predict(self, X_test):
    predictions = []
    for sample in X_test:
        distances = [self.euclidean_distance(sample, x_train) for x_train in self.X_train]
        k_indices = np.argsort(distances)[:self.k]
        knn_labels = [self.y_train[i] for i in k_indices]
        most_common = max(set(knn_labels), key=knn_labels.count)
        predictions.append(most_common)
    return predictions
```

- The `predict` method predicts the class labels for a given set of test samples `X_test`. It iterates over each test sample and performs the following steps:
  - Calculates the Euclidean distances between the test sample and all training samples using list comprehension.
  - Sorts the distances and selects the indices of the `k` nearest neighbors using `np.argsort`.
  - Retrieves the labels of these nearest neighbors from the training labels (`self.y_train`).
  - Determines the most common class label among the `k` nearest neighbors using Python's `max` function and `set` to remove duplicates, and assigns it as the predicted label for the test sample.
  - Appends the predicted label to the `predictions` list.
- Finally, the method returns the list of predicted labels for all test samples.

This comprehensive explanation provides a detailed understanding of each method's purpose and functionality within the `KNNClassifier` class.
